## Description

Muzak is a simple video player that uses the YouTube Data API to fetch & stream videos by video ID or title. Muzak was built to demonstrate the developer's knowledge of the React framework, as well as the ability to fetch data to and from a given API. 

## Wireframes

The following wireframe was created to guide this project:

You can also view it as a PDF [here](docs/wireframes/muzak-wireframe.pdf)


### Features

1. Video Search: Search for videos by title or video ID

2. Video Player: Play videos by video ID or title

3. Video List: Muzak fetches up to 5 videos from YouTube and displays them in a list alongside the main video player

4. Video ID Logs to Console: Due to time constraints, Muzak only logs video ID's to the console at this point in time. To view the video ID's, open the console and click on a video from the list.
